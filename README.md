# IntelligentAgent
Deep Q Reinforce Learning Algorithm for AI Treasure Hunt 
  
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  For this project my job was to study and apply a deep q reinforcement learning algorithm to program a Intelligent Agent. The Intelligent Agent will be trained to complete a treasure hunt maze, the reinforcement algorithm must train the agent to acheive an optimal win rate of 100%. In order to complete this project succesfully, I was given code to create the game environment, the experience replay object which aided in the intelligent agent learning from its own experiences, and build model which built the neural network. Lastly, I was given the code which helped me determine in the agent won or lost the game.
  
  The code that I had to develop myself was the Q-Training algorithm. The algorithm would learn by a mixutre of exploration and eploitation, meaning it was make choices wwithout using a predictive model via exploration. Otherwise, the algoirthm would use the neural network to make choices based on previous actions stores in the model or exploitation. 
  
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  A computer scientist is someone who finds ways to solve problems with the use of technology such as computers. This skill is extremely valueable as technology continues to grow and become more apart of our lives then ever before. 
  
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  In order to approach a probelm as a computer scientist, I start by reading and understand the problem and what it is asking to solve. After identifying the problem, identify the necessary tools needed to solve the problem (programming language, networkk, databases). Apply the best tools for the problem that needs to be solved. 
  
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilitiy to the end user and organization as an AI developer is to ensure that the algorithms that I implemnent are supported with strong development practices. I believe being transparent with end users is important, not having hidden layers, allowing users to control their information and how it is used and collected. Avoid programming bias and making open statement about efforts to avoid bias by maintaining the algorithm and doing regular maintenance.
